        <th scope="row"> What attitude?</th>
        <td>Though his three companions are not royalty, Noctis usually acts as an equal to them. His royal upbringing shines through however, as reflected in his body language, poise, and posture in contrast to his team. According to Director Hajime Tabata, one of Noctis's defining aspects is his "sense of ennui". He regularly dozes off; this is present from his early childhood. Noctis dislikes vegetables, much to Ignis's displeasure, who tries to encourage a healthy diet. Noctis and Prompto share a distaste for bugs and a love for animals, especially pets and chocobos.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Which behaviour? </th>
        <td>As the heir to the throne of Lucis, Noctis can wield the power of kings, and those he associates with share into some of his power. Weapons manifest to his use from thin air, and only he can wield the crystalline royal arms of his forebears; the power to wield all of these weapons at once is called Armiger, during which he is empowered by the souls of his ancestors. He can warp short distances, and phase through solid matter. These powers of teleportation can be used for combat. He can collect elemental power from the environment and craft spells that those with him can also gain access to, but his true magical power is only harnessed via the mythical Ring of the Lucii that allows the wearer to wield the power of the Crystal itself in exchange for the user's own life force. The kings of Lucis have forged covenants with the Astral gods of Eos, and once Noctis does so, he becomes able to call forth the Astrals to aid him.</td>
